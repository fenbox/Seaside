# Seaside

A [LimeChat](http://limechat.net/mac/) theme based on [Wookielight](https://github.com/wookiehangover/wookielight). Each user is assigned one of 16 unqiue colors.

## Installation

Just clone the repo and run bootstrap script:

    $ ./bootstrap.sh

**This assumes app store installation.** Ya know, since its available in
the app store and all.  If you have a pre-existing install just replace
the theme directory on line 10 with `~/Library/Application\
Support/Limechat/Themes`.


## This is what it looks like
